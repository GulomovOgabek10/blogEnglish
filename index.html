            "IT Academy" is a term that represents an educational center or training
  
            platform aimed at acquiring knowledge and enhancing professional skills
            in the field of modern information technology. IT academies operate in
            many countries and cities, and their goal is to provide their students
            and learners with knowledge in areas such as programming, systems
            management, artificial intelligence, and the development of web and
            mobile applications. General features of the IT Academy: Areas of study:
            Programming (Front-end, Back-end, Full-stack) Creating mobile
            applications (Android, iOS) Web Design and User Interface (UI/UX)
            Artificial intelligence and machine learning (Machine Learning)
            Databases and data analysis Cyber ​​security and cloud technologies.
            Courses and training programs: Courses usually last several months and
            include theoretical knowledge as well as work on real projects. Many IT
            academies offer courses for complete entry-level learners, and there are
            also additional courses for experienced professionals. Practice-based
            learning: IT academies typically base their programs on practice,
            meaning students work on real-life projects and issues. This will help
            them to acquire theoretical knowledge faster and gain enough experience
            in the profession. Certification: Many academies award a certificate
            upon successful completion of the training program. These certificates
